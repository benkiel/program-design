## Course Description

This is a class about asking questions, designing processes, building systems, input & output, and combining them together. It is fundamentally experimental in nature.

We are going to explore the unconscious ways your design tools influence your work and what your work would look like if you made the tools used to create it.

Our toolset will be learning and writing code in Python to generate design, experiencing different output techniques in the book studio, and building our own input devices. We will treat the computer as a raw material, not as a polished product. The course assumes no prior programming experience, so don’t worry if you have never written a line of code.

We will have in-class demos, solo and group projects, readings, and talks from practitioners in the field. We’ll be using the free [DrawBot](http://www.drawbot.com) application for MacOS and the [PageBot](http://pagebot.io/) code library.

Along the way we’ll explore questions such as:

* What will design look like when machine learning automates many design tasks? 
* How will you adapt when your software changes?
* What does design look like when you are designing systems to create outcomes instead of designing the outcome?
* How do you design for different contexts at the same time using the same content?
* What would computer-aided design iteration look like?

#### Rules (apologies to [Corita](https://corita.org) [Kent](https://store.corita.org/products/ten-rules-poster))

1. Ask all you can of your professor and your fellow students; we are here to help and support eachother.
2. The only rule is making; through making you will arrive at understanding
3. It is ok to feel lost; everyone feels lost in the unfamiliar, being comfortable in the uncomfortable leads to surprising results 
4. Nothing is a mistake. Save everything.
5. Enjoy yourself when you can, bring humor and lightness to the work
6. Making and editing are different things. Don’t do them at the same time.
7. “We’re breaking all of the rules. Even our own rules. And how do we do that? By leaving plenty of room for X quantities.” —John Cage

#### Disclaimer
_Note:_ This is the second run of this class, as the semester progresses changes to the structure, projects, schedule, etc. may occur. The instructor reserves the right to make modifications to the information on this syllabus throughout the semester.

### Goals
Students will learn how to think systematically about design, how to work in teams, rapid iteration using the computer, sketching, the design of software applications, how to translate digital experiences to analogue and vice versa, and how to learn from failure.

Beyond content-specific goals, this course will develop your ability to objectively evaluate your work, teach you to work iteratively, and deepen your formal and critical vocabulary.

**Students who complete this course successfully will be able to:**

* Conceptualize and program design tools
* Explicate their working methods and habits
* Incorporate iterative working methods into their practice
* Apply systems thinking to design tasks
* Translate digital experiences into analogue contexts and vice versa

### Course fees
The course fee ($40) provides for general shop materials (inks, rags, disposal, etc) and the following provided materials:

* Paper for printing in the book studio
* Print on demand book

Depending on scope of your projects, you may need to purchase additional paper and/or printmaking supplies.

### Daily Work/Homework
Students are expected to do work outside of class to complete assignments and do readings. More outside time will be required for the later assignments in the course. There will be no more than one reading every two weeks. Some outside work will require the use of the book studio during monitor hours; please plan accordingly.

### Class Participation
Work time in the studio (be it virtual or physical) is critical to the successful completion of the class. Students are expected to arrive ready to participate and be fully engaged in the day’s coursework during the entire scheduled class period. Meaning, you are ready to provide critique, participate in formal and informal class discussion, and to discuss your work with peers. That said, we are not on Zoom unless we need to be on zoom. However, you are expected to be responsive on Slack during our class period if we are not meeting on Zoom.

## Course Grading
Grades for this course are based on a combination of self evaluation and per project grades. You will regularly self evaluate three areas of your practice: Process, Output, and Approach.

Per project grades are determined first and foremost on the process of each project. Success is measured by the following criteria: breadth of investigation, strength of concept, communication value, aesthetic quality, thoroughness of completion & finish.

Course grades are not curved, but will be issued on a plus/minus scale. Work handed in after a critique will result in a lowered grade.

### Explanation of Grading System
* **Self Evaluation**: 70 points (69%)
* **Basic Pattern**: 1 point (0.9%)
* **Pattern**: 5 points (4.9%)
* **Poster**: 5 points (4.9%)
* **Buddy Script**: 5 points (4.9%)
* **Data**: 5 points (4.9%)
* **Generated Zine**: 5 points (4.9%)
* **Owned**: 5 points (4.9%)

### Self Evaluation[¹](https://github.com/benkiel/program-design/blob/master/syllabus.md#this-is-not-an-original-idea-for-grading-it-is-taken-from-mitch-goldstein-see-his-formulation-and-twitter-thread-about-it)
The majority of your course grade (69%) is based upon your self evaluations. You are in school to improve and better yourself as a designer, not to spend time trying to figure out what your instructor will give an “A” for. Self evaluation is a method for you to be honest about your work, engage in what you find best serves the project and your interests, and build a skill that has life-long value.

**Criteria** 
You’ll be evaluating three parts of your activity in class:

1. **Process (50% of total score)** 
  The most important part of this course and your education: your making, thinking, and your choices in the course of working. What risks do you take, how widely do you explore, how far do you push your work while making?
2. **Output (25% of total score)** 
  The work turned in. These are final projects and the work due for classes. Evaluation of your output involves evaluation of the work’s aesthetic value, communicative ability, impact, and craft. 
3. **Approach (25% of total score)** 
  How is your attendance, preparation, participation in discussion, and general demeanor in class?

**Method** 
In each area, you'll be giving yourself a score from 1 to 10. These scores will be combined according to the percentages above and your total score (between 1 and 10) will be recorded. These evaluations will happen roughly every three weeks and will not be tied to a specific project. You will base your score on what you did during that block of time, not on a specific project. Unless I **strongly** disagree with your evaluation, this is the score you will receive for that block. Your evaluations are private and will not be shared or discussed with anyone other than you.

### Course-Specific Support
Office hours are over Zoom. There are time slots Monday-Friday, with evening options. Sign up for a time at [calendly.com/benkiel/office-hours](https://calendly.com/benkiel/office-hours). If none of the available office hours work for your schedule, let me know via email, and we can work out a time to meet.

The book studio is open daily for monitor hours. Please refer to the posted schedule for open times.

Additionally, Dmitri Jackson serves as our CDES Technologist. He can be contacted through Canvas or by email, [djackson27@wustl.edu](mailto:djackson27@wustl.edu)­. He can help with software, computer, and printing issues.

### End of the Semester Reviews
**All BFA Communication Design students**, beginning with the spring semester of sophomore year will be scheduled for an end-of-semester faculty review directly following the final week of classes.
**All BFA juniors and seniors in Studio Art** will be scheduled for an end-of-semester faculty review directly following the final week of classes.
**All BFA Fashion Design students**, beginning with the spring semester of sophomore year will be scheduled for an end-of-semester faculty review directly following the final week of classes. 

_Please note:_ reviews are optional for students in the BA and Second Major tracks and will be scheduled by request only. If a review is desired, students must notify Kim McCabe ([kmccabe@wustl.edu](kmccabe@wustl.edu)) and the respective professor no later than the midterm mark of the semester. Students must be in two studio courses to be eligible for faculty review

## Course Policies and Information for Students

### Attendance Policy
Attendance is mandatory and will be documented for all course meetings. Sam Fox students are expected to arrive ready to participate and be fully engaged in the day’s coursework during the entire scheduled class period. If you are attending class online from a time zone that is more than 4 hours different from Central time, we will work out a schedule of meetings and attendance that accommodates your time zone.

Each student is allowed three (3) absences. After three absences, students will receive one full letter grade penalty for each subsequent **unexcused** absence, regardless of the quality of the student’s work. The student’s grade will be lowered further for each consecutive absence after that. An unexcused absence is an absence not due to illness, family emergency, student accommodation, or religious holiday.

Three late arrivals and/or early departures will equal one absence. If a student misses more than 20 minutes of a class, they are considered absent. Missing a review or critique equals two absences. If a student must miss a critique, please inform the professor beforehand. Any student who misses class is responsible for contacting a fellow student to find out what they missed, for making up all work, and for being prepared for the next class.

**The Sam Fox School Attendance Policy remains in place, but accommodations will be made this spring in light of COVID-19. As noted in public health protocols, any student who is diagnosed with COVID, is experiencing symptoms associated with COVID, or has been exposed to COVID directly should not come to class. Please communicate with the instructor immediately about the situation and work toward a commonly understood resolution. In some cases, students may shift their participation online. In other cases, students may need to make up for missing classes or critiques/reviews through other means.**

Participation in major critiques and reviews by all students is essential to the development of all of students. Failure to do so will have an impact on your final grade. Following university policy, class will begin promptly with the start time listed in the undergraduate bulletin and/or the agreed online time with your instructor.

When on Zoom, you are expected to be attentive to class. If on video or screen sharing, be mindful that your background and/or desktop is appropriate for a class setting. Turning on your camera is appreciated —especially when speaking— but not required. Guest appearances by pets are welcome.

All lectures and demos will be recorded for students who are not able to make it to class, these will be posted to Canvas as soon as Zoom is done processing them.

In case of severe medical or family emergencies, contact the Dean of Students Georgia Binnington as soon as possible: [gbinning@wustl.edu](mailto:gbinning@wustl.edu), 314-935-6532. Extreme circumstances will be handled on an individual basis.

### Penalties For Late Work And Requests For Extensions
Late work will incur a 20% penalty for being one class late, with an additional 10% penalty for each subsequent class the work is late. Requests for extensions of up to two class periods may be made in advance of the project due date for all projects save the final project. Students may request one extension for the semester without cause; further extensions are granted based upon circumstances of health or family emergencies.

### Inclusive Learning Environment Statement
This class places great emphasis on keeping all interactions civil, respectful, and supportive of an inclusive learning environment. We strive to follow the maxim that critique serves the work, not the person who made the work (for more, please see [howtocrit.com](http://howtocrit.com). Our feedback and interactions are honest and useful, aimed at improving the work being discussed. If you have any questions or concerns about classroom participation and/or dynamics, please speak to me, Aggie Toppins (Design Area chair), or an advisor.

If you have an WashU Accommodation Letter from Disability Resources, please share that with me at the start of the semester so that we can discuss how your accommodation will be implemented in class. If you have a concern about an assignment, project, test, or quiz, please discuss that with either me, Aggie Toppins (Design Area chair), or an advisor, about any concern you may have about your accommodations whether in relation to classroom participation, dynamics, or logistics. 

### COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols
Exceptions to course policies, expectations, and requirements (including attendance and assignment deadlines) because of COVID-19 diagnosis, symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or exposure to a person with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis will be made in collaboration between the student and instructor. In these cases, please notify your instructor as soon as possible to discuss appropriate accommodations.

**All Danforth Campus students, faculty & staff must complete and pass a daily health self-screening prior coming onto campus or leaving their residence hall room each day. If an individual does not pass the daily self-screening, they must not leave their room or come to campus and must immediately contact [Habif Health and Wellness Center](https://students.wustl.edu/habif-health-wellness-center/) at 314-935-6666 (students) or [Occupational Health](https://wusmhealth.wustl.edu/faculty-and-staff/) at 314-362-5056 (faculty and staff). [Go to screening at wustl.edu](https://screening.wustl.edu).**

While on campus, it is imperative that students follow all public health guidelines established to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission within our community. The full set of University protocols can be found [https://covid19.wustl.edu/health-safety/](https://covid19.wustl.edu/health-safety/). This includes:
* **Each student must visit [screening.wustl.edu](https://screening.wustl.edu) daily to complete the daily self-screening** assessment before coming to campus or leaving their room in residential housing. A passing screening will result in a green checkmark on their phone screen. **Each student is required to show that day’s green check mark to their teacher at the start of each class.**
* **Complying with physical distancing requirements at all times and adhere to signage and environmental cues.** This includes not congregating before or after class as well as during breaks or class activities.
* **Complying with universal masking. All individuals on campus must wear disposable masks or cloth face coverings while occupying indoor public settings**, including: multi-person offices; hallways; stairwells; elevators; meeting rooms; classrooms; restrooms; and when in campus outdoor spaces unless you can maintain six feet of physical distance from others. In the event that a student cannot wear a mask due to a medical condition or other concerns, they should consult with their academic advisors. 
* **Practicing healthy personal hygiene**, including frequent handwashing with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds and/or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. 
* **Complying with cleaning and sanitation protocols**. Students may be responsible for wiping down common surfaces after use, particularly those that might be shared with others (e.g. classroom desks). Instructions for Sam Fox students [can be found here](https://insidesamfox.wustl.edu/covid-19/public-health-safety-protocols/). 

We take your health and the health of our community seriously. Any Danforth Campus student who is **currently diagnosed with COVID-19, is experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or has had direct contact with a person with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis must remain home and isolate yourself from others.** Students who have symptoms and/or do not pass the screening protocol described above must call the Habif Health and Wellness Center at 314-935-6666 for additional instructions.

### Health and Safety, non-COVID
Because of the variety of equipment in the Kranzberg Illustrated Book Studio, you must wear close-toed shoes in the studio. Likewise, any loose clothing should be tied tight when using the equipment. You are not to use any piece of equipment unless supervised. Please refer to the Bixby Hall Print Shop & Book Studio Updated Studio Rules & Shop Policies document for further information on the use of the Book Studio (you can find this on Canvas).

In cases of emergency, call campus Security: x5555 from phones located on every floor (or 935-5555). Security may be called for late-night escort back to on-campus housing. 

### The Book Studio Standard
The book studio is a shared resource that needs to be maintained for everyone using the studio. Thus, the golden rule of the studio is: 
**When you leave, the studio will be cleaner than when you got there.**

This means that no food or drink is allowed in the book studio. As part of the class, you are given part of a flat-file drawer for storage. Do not store wet prints in your drawer. This drawer must be emptied at the end of the semester; if you do not empty your drawer at the end of the semester, your grade will be reduced by 50%. Personal materials left out in the studio —not stored in your flat file— will be thrown away.

### Mental Health
Mental Health Services’ professional staff members work with students to resolve personal and interpersonal difficulties, many of which can affect the academic experience. These include conflicts with or worry about friends or family, concerns about eating or drinking patterns, and feelings of anxiety and depression. See: [Mental Health Services](https://students.wustl.edu/mental-health-services/)

### Center for Diversity and Inclusion (CDI)
The Center for Diversity and Inclusion (CDI) supports and advocates for undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students from underrepresented and/or marginalized populations, collaborates with campus and community partners, and promotes dialogue and social change to cultivate and foster a supportive campus climate for students of all backgrounds, cultures and identities. Visit [Center for Diversity and Inclusion](https://diversityinclusion.wustl.edu/)

### Preferred Name and Gender Inclusive Pronouns
In order to affirm each person’s gender identity and lived experiences, it is important that we ask and check in with others about pronouns. This simple effort can make a profound difference in a person’s experience of safety, respect, and support. See: [Gender Pronouns Information](https://students.wustl.edu/gender-pronouns-information/) and [Preferred Name](https://registrar.wustl.edu/student-records/ssn-name-changes/preferred-name/)

### Archiving work
Save everything you make from this semester until the end. Early sketches, finished pieces, notes, etc. At the end of the semester, you are responsible for turning in photographic evidence of your work. This record may be used by the school in promotional material.

### Course Policies and Information for Students, part two

#### Academic Accommodations
**Reasonable Accommodations for Disabled Students** - Washington University in St. Louis supports the rights of enrolled students to a full and equal educational opportunity and, in compliance with federal, state, and local requirements, is committed to reasonable accommodations for individuals with documented disabilities. Disabled students for whom accommodations may be necessary must be registered with, and provide their faculty official notification through, WUSTL’s **Disability Resources** [students.wustl.edu/disability-resources](https://students.wustl.edu/disability-resources/). Once established, responsibility for disability-related accommodations and access is shared by DR, faculty, and the student. Please contact Disability Resources at 314.935.5970 or [disabilityresources@wustl.edu](mailto:disabilityresources@wustl.edu). 

#### Grade Dispute Policy
The Sam Fox School aims to provide each student with a fair assessment of their academic work and studio. Students have the right to dispute their overall course grade (not individual assignments) if they believe that grade does not accurately reflect the quality of their work. A grade dispute must be submitted to the faculty member who assigned the grade within 30 days of receipt of the grade. The School stresses that every effort to resolve this dispute be made by the faculty and student involved. A student’s eligibility for advancement in sequential coursework requires timely resolution of the grade dispute. For more information visit [samfoxschool.wustl.edu/files/Greivance%20Policy_Update%202019.pdf](https://samfoxschool.wustl.edu/files/Greivance%20Policy_Update%202019.pdf).

#### Religious Holidays
The Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Art recognizes the individual student’s choice in observing religious holidays that occur during periods when classes are scheduled. Students are encouraged to arrange with their instructors to make up work missed as a result of religious observance, and instructors are asked to make every reasonable effort to accommodate such requests. The [Office of Religious, Spiritual and Ethical Life](https://students.wustl.edu/office-religious-spiritual-and-ethical-life/) maintains a [calendar](https://students.wustl.edu/religious-celebration-calendar/) of many religious holidays observed by the WashU community. 

#### Technology Policies
Computers or other electronic devices, including “smart pens” (devices with an embedded computer and digital audio recorder that records the classroom lecture/discussion and links that recording to the notes taken by the student), may be used by students at the discretion of the faculty member to support the learning activities in the classroom. These activities include taking notes and accessing course readings under discussion. If a student wishes to use a smart-pen or other electronic device to audio record lectures or class discussions, they must notify the instructor in advance of doing so. Permission to use recording devices is at the discretion of the instructor, unless this use is an accommodation approved by Disability Resources.

Nonacademic use of laptops and other devices and use of laptops or other devices for other coursework is distracting and seriously disrupts the learning process for other people in the classroom. Neither computers nor other electronic devices are to be used in the classroom during class for nonacademic reasons or for work on other coursework. Nonacademic use includes emailing, texting, social networking, playing games, instant messaging, and use of the Internet. Work on other coursework may include, but is not limited to, use of the Internet, writing papers, using statistical software, analyzing data, and working on quizzes or exams. The nonacademic use of cell phones during class time is prohibited, and they should be set on silent before class begins. In the case of an emergency, please step out of the room to take the call. The instructor has the right to hold students accountable for meeting these expectations, and failure to do so may result in a loss of participation or attendance points, a loss of the privilege of device use in the classroom, or being asked to leave the classroom. 

The Sam Fox School Information Technology Infrastructure has many services for your benefit. Visit [sites.wustl.edu/insidesfs/it](https://sites.wustl.edu/insidesfs/it/) for more information.
