# Programming Design, Online Edition

**Spring 2020, F10 ART 338Y**  
Ben Kiel, [ben@typefounding.com](mailto:ben@typefounding.com).  

## Guiding principals
1. We will do everything as asynchronously as possible. We are in different time zones, under different stressors, dealing with different and difficult situations — trying to meet at one appointed time doesn't fit this reality.
2. Our work will only require a laptop, nothing else.
3. Our technology stack will be Canvas, Slack, and Zoom. The first two you are all using for class and are familiar with, the last is what most if not all classes will be using for video conferencing. You should know that like Canvas, Zoom gathers statistics on usage and engagement that the administration can see. Know that my grading is never based on these usage metrics.
4. We will be kind. This is unknown territory for everyone, and not what we all signed up for at the beginning of the semester. It will be far from perfect, but we will support and be kind to each other as we navigate through the remaining semester, bearing in mind that we are all living through varying degrees of tumult.
5. We will breathe, laugh, and learn.

The above is in conjunction with our already stated ground rules from the original syllabus. These will have new resonance now:

### Rules (apologies to [Corita](https://corita.org) [Kent](https://store.corita.org/products/ten-rules-poster))

1. Ask all you can of your professor and your fellow students; we are here to help and support each other.
2. The only rule is making; through making you will arrive at understanding
3. It is ok to feel lost; everyone feels lost in the unfamiliar, being comfortable in the uncomfortable leads to surprising results 
4. Nothing is a mistake. Save everything.
5. Enjoy yourself when you can, bring humor and lightness to the work
6. Making and editing are different things. Don’t do them at the same time.
7. “We’re breaking all of the rules. Even our own rules. And how do we do that? By leaving plenty of room for X quantities.” —John Cage

## Logistics

*Communication*
: Notifications about assignments, course changes, grades, and anything formal will come via Canvas announcements. Please check your notification settings for Canvas to be sure you get these announcements. Informal communication will be over Slack, this will include feedback on projects, peer questions, and the like. Messages and emails won't be replied to between 6pm CST and 9am CST (one needs to sleep and be with family!)

*Office hours*
: I will have virtual office hours via Zoom Monday—Thursday from 1 to 3pm CST (2pm to 4pm EST, 11am-1pm PST). Link to the standing Zoom hangout will be posted. More than one can join the video call at a time. I will be in my office, working, and talking to you as you drop in. There is no requirement to come to virtual office hours, they are there for you to ask questions/get feedback/etc as needed.

*Discussions*
: We will have two reading discussions based on **What is a Designer** by Norman Potter. These will be assigned as discussions in Canvas. For class discussions, we'll use Slack as our informal space. For small group discussions, if warranted, we will use Zoom.

*Q&A*
: I'll have a running Q&A/trouble shooting channel in Slack to respond with examples to anything you want to try but are stuck trying to do.

### Submitting work
Work will be turned in via Canvas (no one wants to deal with Git in a Pandemic). Due dates will be set to be at the end of the day (11:59pm CST) to be accommodating to all.

## Course schedule
* **Week 11**: March 24 & 26. Introduce Data project, work on Data project, and reading discussion.
* **Week 12**: March 31 & April 2. Work on Data and finish project (due date of Sunday, April 5th).
* **Week 13**: April 7 & 9. Introduce Owned project, and work on project.
* **Week 14**: April 14 & 16. Work on Owned. Reading discussion.
* **Week 15**: April 21 & 23. Work on Owned and finish project (due date of April 26th).

## Grading
We will continue with our current system of grading, as detailed below.

Grades for this course are based on a combination of self evaluation and per project grades. You will regularly self evaluate three areas of your practice: Process, Output, and Approach.

Per project grades are determined first and foremost on the process of each project. Success is measured by the following criteria: breadth of investigation, strength of concept, communication value, aesthetic quality, thoroughness of completion & finish.

Course grades are not curved, but will be issued on a plus/minus scale.

### Explanation of Grading System
* **Self Evaluation**: 40 points 
* **Pattern**: 5 points 
* **Helper**: 5 points 
* **Poster**: 5 points
* **Generated Zine**: 5 points 
* **Data**: 5 points 
* **Owned**: 5 points 

### Self Evaluation[^goldstein]
The majority of your course grade (66%) is based upon your self evaluations. You are in school to improve and better yourself as a designer, not to spend time trying to figure out what your instructor will give an “A” for. Self evaluation is a method for you to be honest about your work, engage in what you find best serves the project and your interests, and build a skill that has life-long value.

**Criteria**  
You’ll be evaluating three parts of your activity in class:

1.  **Process (50% of total score)**  
    The most important part of this course and your education: your making, thinking, and your choices in the course of working. What risks do you take, how widely do you explore, how far do you push your work while making?
2.  **Output (25% of total score)**  
    The work turned in. These are final projects and the work due for classes. Evaluation of your output involves evaluation of the work’s aesthetic value, communicative ability, impact, and craft.  
3.  **Approach (25% of total score)**  
    How is your attendance, preparation, participation in discussion, and general demeanor in class?

**Method**  
In each area, you'll be giving yourself a score from 1 to 10. These scores will be combined according to the percentages above and your total score (between 1 and 10) will be recorded. These evaluations will happen roughly every three weeks and will not be tied to a specific project. You will base your score on what you did during that block of time, not on a specific project. Unless I **strongly** disagree with your evaluation, this is the score you will receive for that block. Your evaluations are private and will not be shared or discussed with anyone other than you.

## Assignments (remaining)

### Generated Zine (finishing)
This is our current project, and was to go into production when we got from spring break. Clearly, we can no longer produce this as a printed riso zine. When we reconvene, we will vote to either make it print on demand, or just turn the project in as digital files.

### Control (canceled)
This assignment requires materials and access to the maker space on campus, **we will not be doing it**. Parts for your miniKbd are all sitting in my office, I'm working on the best way to get them to you if you would like to make this project outside of class.

### Owned (changed)
This assignment will be scaled back, it will still be self generated but less ambitious in scope & reflecting the lack of physical output. The parameters are the same: a self generated project that you work on alone or with a group that uses what you have learned this semester. The time has been reduced, so your scope should also reduce. If you do not wish for a fully open ended assignment, a more defined project based on your interests can be given. 

### Data (new)
This new assignment will explore using a data source (CSV) to generate a series of instagram posts.

## Course Policies and Information for Students

### Attendance Policy
As we are not having any in-person meetings, your attendance is only required at agreed upon virtual meetings in Zoom.

### Penalties For Late Work And Requests For Extensions
To allow flexibility, there will be no penalties for late work. Work must be turned in by the end of the semester, please let me know if extenuating circumstances will make that not possible.

### All other policies
All other applicable policies from our original syllabus are in force and have not changed.

## Course Description

This is a class about asking questions, designing processes, building systems, input & output, and combining them together.  It is fundamentally experimental in nature.

We are going to explore the unconscious ways your design tools influence your work and what your work would look like if you made the tools used to create it.

Our toolset will be learning and writing code in Python to generate design, experiencing different output techniques in the book studio, and building our own input devices. We will treat the computer as a raw material, not as a polished product. The course assumes no prior programming experience, so don’t worry if you have never written a line of code.

We will have in-class demos, solo and group projects, readings, and talks from practitioners in the field. We’ll be using the free [DrawBot](http://www.drawbot.com) application for MacOS and the [PageBot](http://pagebot.io/) code library.

Along the way we’ll explore questions such as:

* What will design look like when machine learning automates many design tasks? 
* How will you adapt when your software changes?
* What does design look like when you are designing systems to create outcomes instead of designing the outcome?
* How do you design for different contexts at the same time using the same content?
* What would computer-aided design iteration look like?

#### Disclaimer
_Note:_ This is a new course, as the semester progresses changes to the structure, projects, schedule, etc. may occur. The instructor reserves the right to make modifications to the information on this syllabus throughout the semester.

### Goals
Students will learn how to think systematically about design, how to work in teams, rapid iteration using the computer, sketching, the design of software applications, how to translate digital experiences to analogue and vice versa, and how to learn from failure.

Beyond content-specific goals, this course will develop your ability to objectively evaluate your work, teach you to work iteratively, and deepen your formal and critical vocabulary.

**Students who complete this course successfully will be able to:**

* Conceptualize and program design tools
* Explicate their working methods and habits
* Incorporate iterative working methods into their practice
* Apply systems thinking to design tasks
* Translate digital experiences into analogue contexts and vice versa
